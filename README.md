# The Beer
Beer is the P2P library for Windows/Linux Systems

# Background Story
In these days, many people think more important on their privacy.
So I think we need a chat program which see chat for only me and my friend.

# Functions
## Secret Chat Room
- The one of big differences between The Beer and normal chat program is the beer has a secret chat room for **me and my friend.** This room only avaliable to enter for me and my friend, because this chat room has password, port or etc, only they know.
## Security
### Auto Chat Log Remove System
- This program **doesn't going through server** and it **doesn't have servers.** So if you don't want to save chat, just turn off program, then it'll be removed.  
### Log File Compression
- I made compression file format that based on **LZ77 algorithm** which usually used on **zip file.** If you don't want to see your chat for the other people, you just use this function to save your chat log.
